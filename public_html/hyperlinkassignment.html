<h2>Lover Is a Day</h2>

<i>by Cuco</i>
<br>

<p>
  <a id="t1"></a>Time changed, we're different <br>
  But my mind still says redundant things<br>
  Can I not think?<br>
  Will you love this part of me?<br>
  My lover is a day I can't forget<br>
</p>

<p>
  <a id="t2"></a>Furthering my distance from you<br>
  Realistically I can't leave now<br>
  But I'm okay as long as you<br>
  Keep me from going crazy<br>
  Keep me from going crazy<br>
</p>

<p>
  <a id="t3"></a>Straight up ahead you'll find a sign<br>
That says you can't get by with a lie<br>
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path<br>
And made my life harder, lying 'bout the stupid **<br>** I say<br>
Then you wouldn't know a single thing about
How I feel about you<br>
And those really dumb things people feel<br>
</p>

<p>
<a id="t4"></a>I'll take the bumpy road, it'll probably break my legs <br>
As long as I don't show you what's ruining my head<br>
Funny thing about you is you read me pretty well<br>
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well<br>
Annoying you with smoke signals, asking you for help<br>
'Cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell<br>
</p>

<p>
  <a id="t5"></a>Me and Mr. Heart, we say the cutest things about you<br>
How you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you<br>
Suffocated from the radiated air around us<br>
Full of happiness we don't have<br>
Brightness gone, so dark without you, girl<br>
</p>

<p>
<a id="t6"></a>Time changed, we're different<br>
But my mind still says redundant things<br>
Can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?<br>
My lover is a day I can't forget<br>
</p>

<p>
<a id="t7"></a>Furthering my distance from you<br>
Realistically I can't leave now<br>
But I'm okay as long as you<br>
Keep me from going crazy<br>
Keep me from going crazy<br>
